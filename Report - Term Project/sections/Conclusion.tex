\section{Conclusion}
The project aimed to develop a deep learning model for ECG heartbeat classification using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset. The model classifies ECG heartbeats into five distinct categories while achieving a minimum accuracy of 95\% on the test dataset. Various AI models were compared and evaluated based on key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore the model was required to generalize well, avoid overfitting and ensure robustness on unseen ECG signals. The models did generally perform well on the test dataset, but had problems in classifying the Supraventricular and Fusion classes. For real world applications, improvements are needed to ensure reliable classification of these classes and that deseases are not missed.
The models were trained on an M2 MacBook Air within five hours and complied with EU regulations regarding medical AI and GDPR.
